> CVL-OT-MetaChatDKG will serve as the user interface for accessing and interacting with the knowledge assets sourced from the DKG backend.
It will provide an **immersive and visually engaging environment** for users. The visual extension will include features such as ***rendering graphs, a voice chat interface, and other interactive elements*** to enhance the user experience.
>  Leverage DKG Backend to source the knowledge assets and handle user queries.
- Integration of knowledge assets to the Metaverse
- Assets Sourcing and Query Forwarding
> Develop integration components that will serve as a bridge between the Canvasland Metaverse and the DKG backend.
Create **open-source codes** for the ChatDKG framework that allows DKG builders to easily plug in their knowledge assets into CVL-OT-MetaChatDKG via ***CVL-WebXR SDK***.
