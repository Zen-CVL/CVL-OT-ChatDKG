# Design Concept and Purpose
CVL-OT-MetaChatDKG is an **Innovative and Immersive AI Search Engine** that combines the power of the CanvasLand Metaverse Interface with DKG technology.
It enables users to seamlessly interact and collaborate in a virtual environment while leveraging the collective knowledge stored in the DKG.
CVL-OT-MetaChatDKG integrates advanced rendering capabilities, allowing users to visualize complex data and graphs in an intuitive and interactive manner.

> CVL-OT-MetaChatDKG will serve as the user interface for accessing and interacting with the knowledge assets sourced from the DKG backend.

Provide an **immersive and visually engaging environment** for users while the DKG serves as the backbone acting as a decentralized repository of knowledge assets. 

Users can tap into the vast pool of trusted information to make informed decisions and discover new insights.
The visual extension will include features such as ***rendering graphs, a voice chat interface, and other interactive elements*** to enhance the user experience.

> Leverage DKG Backend to source the knowledge assets and handle user queries.
- Integration of knowledge assets to the Metaverse
- Assets Sourcing and Query Forwarding

Integration components will be developed that serve as the bridge between the Canvasland Metaverse and the DKG backend. 
Create **open-source codes** for the ChatDKG framework that allows DKG builders to plug in their knowledge assets into CVL-OT-MetaChatDKG via ***CVL-UnitySDK***.
